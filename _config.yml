  Hi, my name's Renan ... I'm a former DevSecOps working in a Banking environment with BACEN (Central Bank of Brazil) and SPB (Brazilian payment system). With active participation in Linux and Windows systems administration, I was also responsible for project management in this area. 
  
  Now working as a Security Engineer focused on building secure and highly distributed systems inside Cloud environments.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Linux</mark>, <mark>Kubernetes</mark> and <mark>AWS</mark>
